##  #Education #Health #Defence #Office productivity

We are proposing a new method to save and share all the documents related to Education, health or defence by using a decentralized storage unit and using sia blockchain based skynet portals to access records.With power transfer using our decentralized means we can minimize the attack vector which we were exposed to while using central servers.Our Web-app makes it possible to upload a document by the person itself  so that the information is only limited to oneself and not under the rule of a central authority.

Beside being safe ,secure and easy to use it also helps us to save paper and prevent us to go outside in this pandemic for document verification and also helps us at examination center to prevent group up of students to view their class and seat number.

It has much more scope ,also in field other than edudation.Student records are endless, and with blockchain technology, assets like attendance, courses, payments toward tuition if they attend a private school, grades, coursework, and even their diploma can become part of their personal blockchain record.

Open up `presentation stuff` folder to get access to more stuff relating to our project demo.
